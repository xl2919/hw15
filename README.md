# IEOR 4501: Tools for Analytics Final Project - Squirrel Tracker 
## Project Description
In this web application, the user can import the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw) and view the squirrel data on it.
